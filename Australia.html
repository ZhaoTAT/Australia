    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent at least <em>60,000</em> years ago
       and developed complex hunter-gatherer societies and oral histories. </p>
    <p>Dutch navigators led by <strong>Abel Tasman</strong> were the first Europeans to land in
       Australia in <em>1606</em>, and they mapped the western and northern coasts. </P>
    <p>They named the continent New Holland but made no attempts to permanently
       settle it. In <em>1770</em>, English captain <strong>James Cook</strong> sailed to the east coast
       of Australia, named it New South Wales, and claimed it for Great Britain.

     <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>25,809,973 (July 2021 est.)</p>

        <p>The total population presents one overall measure of the potential
          impact of the country on the world and within its region. Note: Starting
          with the <em>1993</em> Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)
          have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>
        <p>These countries are currently:

          <ul>
            <li>The Bahamas</li>
            <li>Benin</li>
            <li>Haiti</li>
            <li>Brazil</li>
            <li>Kenya</li>
            <li>Burma</li>
            <li>Cambodia</li>
            <li>Cameroon</li>
            <li>Gabon</li>
            <li>Zambia</li>
          </ul>

        <p>population is primarily located on the periphery, with the highest
           concentration of people residing in the east and southeast. a secondary
           population center is located in and around Perth in the west</p>
        <p>of the States and Territories, New South Wales has, by far, the largest
           population. the interior, or <strong>"outback"</strong>, has a very sparse population.</p>
