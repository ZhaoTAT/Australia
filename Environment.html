    <p>soil erosion from overgrazing, deforestation, industrial development,
       urbanization, and poor farming practices.</p>
    <p>limited natural freshwater resources, soil salinity rising due to the
       use of poor quality water, drought, desertification; clearing for agricultural purposes threatens</p>
    <p>the natural habitat of many unique animal and plant species; disruption
       of the fragile ecosystem has resulted in significant floral extinctions.</p>
    <p>the Great Barrier Reef off the northeast coast, the largest coral reef
       in the world, is threatened by increased shipping and its popularity
       as a tourist site, overfishing, pollution, and invasive species are
       also problems</p>
